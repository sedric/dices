Simple dice roller

Why
===

Just wanted to roll some dice for a RPG session. But didn't have an internet connection. So I coded a simple script.

How
===

As if you write it.

If I need to roll a D4 with a bonus and 2 D6 with a malus, just launch :

    # ./dices.sh 1d4+1 2D6-2
    1d4+1 : 4 ( 3)
    2D6-2 : 4 ( 3 3)

Numbers in parenthesis are just informations about dices results.
